# HavelHakimiVisualiser

Using the networkx Python package to create a script which runs the Havel-Hakimi Algorithm. 
If the algorithm determines that the degree sequence is graphical, then it produces a graph from each step of the algorithm. 
This demonstrates how to reconstruct a graph corresponding to the inputted degree sequence by adding nodes to the outputted degree sequence of this algorithm.
